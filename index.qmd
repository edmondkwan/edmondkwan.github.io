## About me

I am a clinician-scientist and genitourinary cancer medical oncologist at Eastern Health in Melbourne, Australia. I currently serve as Laboratory Head and Senior Research Fellow at Eastern Health Clinical School, Monash University, with a cross-appointment within the Biomedicine Discovery Institute Prostate Cancer Research Group. 

After completing my specialist training, I pursued a PhD at Monash University, focusing on prostate cancer genomics. I then relocated to Vancouver, Canada, where I completed a genitourinary clinical fellowship at BC Cancer and a postdoctoral fellowship at the Vancouver Prostate Centre, University of British Columbia. My postdoctoral research centered on developing tissue and circulating tumour DNA biomarkers to predict treatment outcomes in lethal metastatic prostate cancer, using samples collected from prospective clinical trials and large biobanks to explore disease biology and tumour evolution. In October 2024, I returned to Australia to begin my independent research career. 

My research interests encompass diverse disciplines, including molecular biology, bioinformatics, clinical trials, biobanking, clinical database development, and translational medicine. By combining expertise in cancer genomics and clinical oncology, my research team strives to understand how genomic and epigenomic alterations identified in both tumour tissue and blood can better guide therapeutic decision-making in patients with urological cancers.
