He subsequently pursued his interest in prostate cancer and genomics research, completing a PhD on biomarkers in metastatic prostate cancer at Monash University, before heading overseas to Vancouver, Canada, to complete a genitourinary clinical fellowship (BC Cancer) and postdoctoral fellowship (Vancouver Prostate Centre, University of British Columbia).\nDr Kwan’s expertise encompasses diverse disciplines, including molecular biology, bioinformatics, clinical trials, biobanking, database development, and translational medicine. By combining expertise in cancer genomics and clinical oncology, his research team will strive to understand how genomic and epigenomic alterations identified in tumour tissue and blood can better guide therapeutic decision-making in patients with urological cancers."
